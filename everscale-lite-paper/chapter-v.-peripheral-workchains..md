# Chapter V. Peripheral Workchains.

Weâ€™ve already established that WorkChains scale the network when more processing power is needed. These WorkChains are called Processing WorkChains. However, there are also Peripheral WorkChains. They operate like the peripheral devices that you connect to your computer, for example, a printer or a hard drive. They're like resources that your computer can use and support. Ever OS is no different in that regard.

Let's consider one example, a DriveChain. This is a decentralized storage device for Ever OS. It is a chain optimized for storage of large objects. DriveChains have special smart contracts residing on them. In order to store a file in the DriveChain, one needs to deploy the file index smart contract (like an index used in Unix or Linux operating systems), which contains certain information allowing for storage and for the retrieval of files and pay for that storage.

We can imagine multitudes of different Peripheral WorkChains. Perhaps ones specially optimized for really long-term or forever storage of files. Anyone can launch a Peripheral WorkChain at any time, while providing economic incentives for validators to join. It can be used exactly like plugging your devices in any modern operating system.
